# Bloc-GetIt-Lab

## Overview
In this lab we were tasked with making a dynamic counter where two numbers change on a button click

## Counter Page
In this page the user can input thier selected number and click on count, after that the number To Count will be set, and the counter will be set to 0, then when the user clicks again, they will be able to change the counter until it reaches the set number.
